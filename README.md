# My Ranger Configurations

## Install

Download the `ranger` source code from [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger)

> git clone https://github.com/ranger/ranger.git

Install it from `make` or `python` 

> sudo make install

> sudo python setup.py install --optimize=1 --record=install_log.txt

This also saves a list of all installed files to install_log.txt, which you can use to uninstall ranger.
